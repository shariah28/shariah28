Hi! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ADSJHOoIvyjKM/giphy.gif" width="40" alt="Cool GIF">

##
I'm [Shay](https://www.shariahallen.com/), an aspiring software engineer from Brooklyn, NY. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Jacksonville University, April 2024. 

I'm primarily interested in **game development and full-stack development**, so I'm currently sharpening my skills to become a better fit. I enjoy tackling complex problems through ambitious & impactful projects, striving to create innovative solutions that contribute meaningful advancements.

I love tackling ambitious projects, exploring tech trends, coding, and learning new things. When I'm not coding, I'm interested in following the latest developments in space exploration, robotics, AI, & gaming. I also love to watch anime & cartoons, reading, baking, & playing video games on my free time. 

Follow my journey on here as I continue to learn, develop, and publish new projects!

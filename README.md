- 👋 Hi, I’m @shariah28 aka Shay.
- 👀 I’m interested in video game development/design and software engineering. I plan on starting my own game development company in the near future, that focuses primarily on psychological horror, multiplayer, and open world games, I specifically draw inspiration from GTA, Mortal Kombat, COD, Outlast, and Resident Evil. Outside of computer science I enjoy video games (Mortal Kombat, COD, God of War, Need for Speed and GTA), anime (Dragon Ball, Jojo's, One Piece, Assassination Classroom, etc)., cartoons (Bob's Burger's, Family Guy, The Boondocks, Chowder, etc.) and reading on my free time.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Unreal Engine to become a game developer.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on game development projects within any language as I'm always open to learning something new, as well as other projects related to software engineering.
